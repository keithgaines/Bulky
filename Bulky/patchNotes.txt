Issues I ran into: 

IEmailSender causing Register page to not render.
	Problem: IEmailSender service wasn't registered in dependency injection in program.cs. 
	Fix: 
		Register it under ConfigureServices
		Researched. Setup (incomplete) to use SendGrid API to send email instead of using smtp.


		Issue resolved couple lecture videos later. Setup EmailSender implementation to return taskcompleted instead of using sendgrid API. 


Setup User Roles
Assigns Role at registration
